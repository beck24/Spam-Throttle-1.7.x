		posts, 2 bookmarks, and 2 comments in 4 minutes, then they have exceeded a global limit of 5
		creations in 5 minutes and will suffer the consequences.  Set the global
		setting fairly leniently, and use the specific content type limits to be more vigilant on
		certain types of spam to reduce the number of false positives.  Each site is different, and it will
		probably be a trial-and-error approach to finding the right settings.
		Each time a user exceeds the limit they will be reported to administrators
		via the reported_content plugin.  Below you can set what happens to a user that exceeds the set limits.
		If a setting is left blank or set to 0, then the limit will default to the global setting (if that is set).",
